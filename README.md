# Login with Windows Form

This repository provides a sample implementation of a user login system using Windows Forms in C#. It is intended for beginners and intermediate developers who want to understand the basics of authentication in a desktop application.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication:**  
  Simple username and password based login mechanism.

- **Windows Forms UI:**  
  User-friendly graphical interface using Windows Forms.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Ensures that fields are not left empty and basic checks for security.

- **Extendable Logic:**  
  Easily adapt the logic to connect to a real database or other authentication backends.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Displays error messages for invalid credentials and empty input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- .NET Framework (suitable for WinForms, e.g., 4.7.2+)


## Usage

1. When the application starts, you’ll see the login form.
2. Enter your username and password.
   - Example credentials (hardcoded, for demo purposes):  
     - Username: `admin`  
     - Password: `password`
3. Click the **Login** button.
4. If the credentials are correct, you’ll be logged in (and typically redirected to the main app window).
5. If credentials are invalid, an error message will appear.

> **Note:**  
> The current implementation uses hardcoded credentials for demonstration. For production, replace this logic with real database validation.

## Customization & Extension

- **Changing Authentication Logic:**  
  Modify the authentication logic in the appropriate event handler (usually in the code-behind for the login form).

- **Connecting to a Database:**  
  Integrate with SQL Server, SQLite, or any other database by updating the authentication logic to query user credentials.

- **UI Enhancements:**  
  Use the Windows Forms Designer in Visual Studio to customize the look and feel.

- **Security Notes:**  
  - Never store passwords in plain text.
  - Always use secure password hashing and validation in production.
  - Consider implementing account lockout, password reset, and other security features.
